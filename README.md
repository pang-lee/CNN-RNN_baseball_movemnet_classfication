# CNN-RNN_baseball_video_movemnet_classfication

It is a project that can classify the baseball movement by using CNN with RNN  
InceptionV3 to extract the video feature and than use RNN for reading the temporal data  
And it will auto generate the train, test and random folder  
train and test folder are using in model, random folder is getting out resource data for testing this model  
In deed it can classify the most of the video data by changing the dataset
